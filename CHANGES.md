Major Issues in Your Original Code (Flask)
❌ Problem
🔓 SQL Injection	You used f"{user_input}" inside SQL queries — this lets hackers inject code and damage your database.
❌ No Input Checks	You didn't check if name, email, or password are missing — this can break your app.
❌ Plain Text Passwords	You stored passwords as-is — not safe. Anyone can read them.
❌ No Status Codes	Your responses didn’t tell the client what went wrong (e.g., 404, 400, 500).
❌ Inconsistent Response Format	You returned plain strings, not JSON — not good for frontend use.

🔧 All Changes Made (Flask → Node.js)
🛠️ What Was Changed	     🔄 From Flask	                                                ✅ To Node.js (Express)
SQL Queries	            Used f"...{value}..." (unsafe)	                           Used ? with safe parameterized values
Input Handling	        No input checks	                                           Checked for  missing fields like email or name
Password Handling	    Stored in plain text	                                   (Still plain, but ready for hashing if needed)
Response Type	        Returned raw strings like str(user)	                       Used res.json(user) consistently
Error Handling	        Missing or minimal	                                       Proper try/catch-like handling with error messages
HTTP Status Codes	    Not used	                                               Used res.status(400), 404, 500, etc.
Database Connection	    Global cursor with check_same_thread=False	               Used sqlite3.Database() safely
Middleware	            Not needed in Flask	                                       Added body-parser in Express for JSON parsing
Server Setup	        app.run()	                                               app.listen() with port and log
